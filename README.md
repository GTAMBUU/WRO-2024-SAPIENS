WRO-2024-SAPIENS

Throughout this read me make sure to link to other parts of the github, 
For example, I mention the strategy to dodge obstacles, I link the code module that covers that

## Engineering Materials
All the materials used for our solution
1. Also numbered
2. Second material
3. etc...

## Contents
- [Source Code](src/)
This is just a test to see if content linking works

## Introduction
Brief intro on our solution

## Strategy
Explain what strategy we used for our solution
Make sure to link code here and mention how we detected and dodged the obstacles

## Mobility 
Explain how we managed the mobility
Link the chasis and models
The design for the steer
Make sure to include the problem we faced with the angle range
how it is 80-120 but 90 is stationary
Also include the speed management
the equations used for speed

## Code Explanation
Explaining different modules used and stuff
Make sure to link 

## ELectromechanical Components
Power source
Sensors used
How every electro mechanical component connects
Make sure to link the wiring diagram and all the pictures of the batteries and the sensors
Also link the part of the code that covers sensors and detection
Should mention Nicla here too
